Description:

My general design approach was minimalistic, typography-focused artwork. It's heavily inspired by Swiss design, but with my own personal palette in mind.

Development-wise, it was quite simple as there weren't really a lot of images or backgrounds. I did face the challenge of how to handle subpages and how to allow navigation between them and the main pages, as I've never done that in this class before. I initially didn't realise how many pages I was actually going to end up with, but thankfully they were mostly similar in layout. 

Personally, I've been feeling a lot more comfortable with choosing between grid and flex after this project, which are my two favourite things I learned in this class. Custom properties also significantly sped up the process as well, eliminating the need to declare specific properties each time. The whole learning experience was quite enjoyable.
